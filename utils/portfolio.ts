  summary:
    "With over a year of experience in Ethereum blockchain development, I've deployed ERC-20 tokens, ERC-721 NFTs, and multi-signature contracts on the Sepolia testnet using Foundry. I specialize in integrating smart contracts with React.js, Next.js, and Tailwind CSS. My background also includes Web2 development with Vue.js, Node.js, and MongoDB, and I'm well-versed in DEXs, DeFi protocols, and decentralized storage like IPFS. Ready for new Web3 challenges. Let's build something great!",
